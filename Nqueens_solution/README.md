# Trying to implement a backtracking algorithm to solve the NQueens problem
I implemented a version of this solution in python in this repo shown below
* [Nqueens python](https://github.com/Bradkibs/alx-interview/tree/main/0x05-nqueens)

I learnt about closures in rust in due to the struct over class based approach
rust uses. It was fun and challenging too.
