# Trying to implement a backtracking algorithm to solve the NQueens problem
I implemented a version of this solution in python in this repo shown below
* [Nqueens python](https://github.com/Bradkibs/alx-interview/tree/main/0x05-nqueens)

## I learnt about:
* closures in rust due to the struct over class based approach rust uses.
* when to use `unwrap` and `expect`.
* How to read from stdio
