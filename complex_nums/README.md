# Experimenting on complex numbers
## Points noted are:
* `use` keyword pulls crates into local scope
* To access fields, Rust program uses the dot operator `.field_name`
* Precision is maintained in complex numbers than normal floats
* There is more than one way to initialize types by using the type name and assigning their fields values with curly braces {} `or` using a new method `new()` for simplicity.
